	Abstract = {Detection of protein families in large databases is one of the principal research objectives in structural and functional genomics. Protein family classification can significantly contribute to the delineation of functional diversity of homologous proteins, the prediction of function based on domain architecture or the presence of sequence motifs as well as comparative genomics, providing valuable evolutionary insights. We present a novel approach called TRIBE-MCL for rapid and accurate clustering of protein sequences into families. The method relies on the Markov cluster (MCL) algorithm for the assignment of proteins into families based on precomputed sequence similarity information. This novel approach does not suffer from the problems that normally hinder other protein sequence clustering algorithms, such as the presence of multi-domain proteins, promiscuous domains and fragmented proteins. The method has been rigorously tested and validated on a number of very large databases, including SwissProt, InterPro, SCOP and the draft human genome. Our results indicate that the method is ideally suited to the rapid and accurate detection of protein families on a large scale. The method has been used to detect and categorise protein families within the draft human genome and the resulting families have been used to annotate a large proportion of human proteins.},

The general method is memory-based reasoning; they record what the user likes/does and use nearest-neighbor techniques to make suggestions. They learn by (1) observation of the user, (2) user feedback to suggestions, (3) explicit training by the user, and (4) asking advice from other agents. The four programs are for email handling, meeting scheduling, netnews filtering, and book/music recommendations.},

	Abstract = {KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) is a knowledge base for systematic analysis of gene functions, linking genomic information with higher order functional information. The genomic information is stored in the GENES database, which is a collection of gene catalogs for all the completely sequenced genomes and some partial genomes with up-to-date annotation of gene functions. The higher order functional information is stored in the PATHWAY database, which contains graphical representations of cellular processes, such as metabolism, membrane transport, signal transduction and cell cycle. The PATHWAY database is supplemented by a set of ortholog group tables for the information about conserved subpathways (pathway motifs), which are often encoded by positionally coupled genes on the chromosome and which are especially useful in predicting gene functions. A third database in KEGG is LIGAND for the information about chemical compounds, enzyme molecules and enzymatic reactions. KEGG provides Java graphics tools for browsing genome maps, comparing two genome maps and manipulating expression maps, as well as computational tools for sequence comparison, graph comparison and path computation. The KEGG databases are daily updated and made freely available (http://www. genome.ad.jp/kegg/).},

	Abstract = {The TRANSFAC database on eukaryotic transcriptional regulation, comprising data on transcription factors, their target genes and regulatory binding sites, has been extended and further developed, both in number of entries and in the scope and structure of the collected data. Structured fields for expression patterns have been introduced for transcription factors from human and mouse, using the CYTOMER database on anatomical structures and developmental stages. The functionality of Match, a tool for matrix-based search of transcription factor binding sites, has been enhanced. For instance, the program now comes along with a number of tissue-(or state-)specific profiles and new profiles can be created and modified with Match Profiler. The GENE table was extended and gained in importance, containing amongst others links to LocusLink, RefSeq and OMIM now. Further, (direct) links between factor and target gene on one hand and between gene and encoded factor on the other hand were introduced. The TRANSFAC public release is available at http://www.gene-regulation.com. For yeast an additional release including the latest data was made available separately as TRANSFAC Saccharomyces Module (TSM) at http://transfac.gbf.de. For CYTOMER free download versions are available at http://www.biobase.de:8080/index.html.},

	Abstract = {The tissue-specific pattern of mRNA expression can indicate important clues about gene function. High-density oligonucleotide arrays offer the opportunity to examine patterns of gene expression on a genome scale. Toward this end, we have designed custom arrays that interrogate the expression of the vast majority of protein-encoding human and mouse genes and have used them to profile a panel of 79 human and 61 mouse tissues. The resulting data set provides the expression patterns for thousands of predicted genes, as well as known and poorly characterized genes, from mice and humans. We have explored this data set for global trends in gene expression, evaluated commonly used lines of evidence in gene prediction methodologies, and investigated patterns indicative of chromosomal organization of transcription. We describe hundreds of regions of correlated transcription and show that some are subject to both tissue and parental allele-specific expression, suggesting a link between spatial expression and imprinting.},

	Abstract = {MOTIVATION: High-throughput experiments are being performed at an ever-increasing rate to systematically elucidate protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks for model organisms, while the complexities of higher eukaryotes have prevented these experiments for humans. RESULTS: The Online Predicted Human Interaction Database (OPHID) is a web-based database of predicted interactions between human proteins. It combines the literature-derived human PPI from BIND, HPRD and MINT, with predictions made from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster and Mus musculus. The 23,889 predicted interactions currently listed in OPHID are evaluated using protein domains, gene co-expression and Gene Ontology terms. OPHID can be queried using single or multiple IDs and results can be visualized using our custom graph visualization program.

Novel high-throughput techniques are generating massive data sets on various aspects of such systems. Here, we perform analysis of a highly diverse collection of genomewide data sets, including gene expression, protein interactions, growth phenotype data, and transcription factor binding, to reveal the modular organization of the yeast system. By integrating experimental data of heterogeneous sources and types, we are able to perform analysis on a much broader scope than previous studies. At the core of our methodology is the ability to identify modules, namely, groups of genes with statistically significant correlated behavior across diverse data sources. Numerous biological processes are revealed through these modules, which also obey global hierarchical organization. We use the identified modules to study the yeast transcriptional network and predict the function of >800 uncharacterized genes. Our analysis framework, SAMBA (Statistical-Algorithmic Method for Bicluster Analysis), enables the processing of current and future sources of biological information and is readily extendable to experimental techniques and higher organisms.},

@article{Hannenhalli:2003,
	Abstract = {The cis-element profile (or cis-profile) of a gene refers to the collection of transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) regulating the transcription of the gene. Underlying the various published studies that attempt to discover cis-elements in the vicinity of co-expressed genes via pattern detection algorithms, there is an implicit assumption that a correlation exists between co-expressed genes and their cis-profiles. In this study, we show that the cis-similarity, defined as the proportion of shared TFBS between two cis-element profiles, is higher for functionally linked interacting proteins as well as for members of a signal transduction pathway. A similar analysis of the enzymes catalyzing the conversion of adjacent substrates to products in a collection of metabolic pathways, did not reveal higher cis-similarity. The analysis is based on three distinct sources of publicly available data, namely, 1) the BIND database of interacting proteins, 2) known interactions in NMDAR protein complex, 3) the apoptosis pathway and nine pathways related to metabolism of cofactors and vitamins all from KEGG. Additionally, we analyze the cis-element profiles of all the genes in the glutamate receptor (GR) sub-complex of NMDAR complex to detect a set of cis-elements that occur adjacent to a majority of the genes. We show that most of the corresponding transcription factors are known to be involved in GR regulation by comparing our findings with the published biomedical literature. In addition, we were able to detect transcripts whose gene products associate with GR by searching for transcripts that share the same regulatory signals as those detected for GR. This suggests a novel computational methodology for constructing high-order gene regulatory models and detecting co-regulated gene products.},

@article{Wall:2001,
	Abstract = {SUMMARY: We have developed two novel methods for Singular Value Decomposition analysis (SVD) of microarray data. The first is a threshold-based method for obtaining gene groups, and the second is a method for obtaining a measure of confidence in SVD analysis. Gene groups are obtained by identifying elements of the left singular vectors, or gene coefficient vectors, that are greater in magnitude than the threshold W N(-1/2), where N is the number of genes, and W is a weight factor whose default value is 3. The groups are non-exclusive and may contain genes of opposite (i.e. inversely correlated) regulatory response. The confidence measure is obtained by systematically deleting assays from the data set, interpolating the SVD of the reduced data set to reconstruct the missing assay, and calculating the Pearson correlation between the reconstructed assay and the original data. This confidence measure is applicable when each experimental assay corresponds to a value of parameter that can be interpolated, such as time, dose or concentration. Algorithms for the grouping method and the confidence measure are available in a software application called SVD Microarray ANalysis (SVDMAN). In addition to calculating the SVD for generic analysis, SVDMAN provides a new means for using microarray data to develop hypotheses for gene associations and provides a measure of confidence in the hypotheses, thus extending current SVD research in the area of global gene expression analysis.},

@article{Horn:2003,
	Abstract = {MOTIVATION: This paper introduces the application of a novel clustering method to microarray expression data. Its first stage involves compression of dimensions that can be achieved by applying SVD to the gene-sample matrix in microarray problems. Thus the data (samples or genes) can be represented by vectors in a truncated space of low dimensionality, 4 and 5 in the examples studied here. We find it preferable to project all vectors onto the unit sphere before applying a clustering algorithm. The clustering algorithm used here is the quantum clustering method that has one free scale parameter. Although the method is not hierarchical, it can be modified to allow hierarchy in terms of this scale parameter. RESULTS: We apply our method to three data sets. The results are very promising. On cancer cell data we obtain a dendrogram that reflects correct groupings of cells. In an AML/ALL data set we obtain very good clustering of samples into four classes of the data. Finally, in clustering of genes in yeast cell cycle data we obtain four groups in a problem that is estimated to contain five families. AVAILABILITY: Software is available as Matlab programs at http://neuron.tau.ac.il/~horn/QC.htm.},

	Abstract = {We describe the use of the matrix eigenvalue decomposition (EVD) and pseudoinverse projection and a tensor higher-order EVD (HOEVD) in reconstructing the pathways that compose a cellular system from genome-scale nondirectional networks of correlations among the genes of the system. The EVD formulates a genes x genes network as a linear superposition of genes x genes decorrelated and decoupled rank-1 subnetworks, which can be associated with functionally independent pathways. The integrative pseudoinverse projection of a network computed from a "data" signal onto a designated "basis" signal approximates the network as a linear superposition of only the subnetworks that are common to both signals and simulates observation of only the pathways that are manifest in both experiments. We define a comparative HOEVD that formulates a series of networks as linear superpositions of decorrelated rank-1 subnetworks and the rank-2 couplings among these subnetworks, which can be associated with independent pathways and the transitions among them common to all networks in the series or exclusive to a subset of the networks. Boolean functions of the discretized subnetworks and couplings highlight differential, i.e., pathway-dependent, relations among genes. We illustrate the EVD, pseudoinverse projection, and HOEVD of genome-scale networks with analyses of yeast DNA microarray data.},

	Abstract = {We describe the use of a higher-order singular value decomposition (HOSVD) in transforming a data tensor of genes x "x-settings," that is, different settings of the experimental variable x x "y-settings," which tabulates DNA microarray data from different studies, to a "core tensor" of "eigenarrays" x "x-eigengenes" x "y-eigengenes." Reformulating this multilinear HOSVD such that it decomposes the data tensor into a linear superposition of all outer products of an eigenarray, an x- and a y-eigengene, that is, rank-1 "subtensors," we define the significance of each subtensor in terms of the fraction of the overall information in the data tensor that it captures. We illustrate this HOSVD with an integration of genome-scale mRNA expression data from three yeast cell cycle time courses, two of which are under exposure to either hydrogen peroxide or menadione. We find that significant subtensors represent independent biological programs or experimental phenomena. The picture that emerges suggests that the conserved genes YKU70, MRE11, AIF1, and ZWF1, and the processes of retrotransposition, apoptosis, and the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway that these genes are involved in, may play significant, yet previously unrecognized, roles in the differential effects of hydrogen peroxide and menadione on cell cycle progression. A genome-scale correlation between DNA replication initiation and RNA transcription, which is equivalent to a recently discovered correlation and might be due to a previously unknown mechanism of regulation, is independently uncovered.},

	Abstract = {Motivation: High-throughput protein interaction detection methods
	are strongly affected by false positive and false negative results.
	Focused experiments are needed to complement the large-scale methods
	by validating previously detected interactions but it is often difficult
	to decide which proteins to probe as interaction partners. Developing
	reliable computational methods assisting this decision process is
	a pressing need in bioinformatics. Results: We show that we can use
	the conserved properties of the protein network to identify and validate
	interaction candidates. We apply a number of machine learning algorithms
	to the protein connectivity information and achieve a surprisingly
	good overall performance in predicting interacting proteins. Using
	a leave-one-out' approach we find average success rates between 20
	and 40% for predicting the correct interaction partner of a protein.
	We demonstrate that the success of these methods is based on the
	presence of conserved interaction motifs within the network. Availability:
	A reference implementation and a table with candidate interacting
	partners for each yeast protein are available at http://www.protsuggest.org.

@article{Amin06,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND:After complete sequencing of a number of genomes the focus
	has now turned to proteomics. Advanced proteomics technologies such
	as two-hybrid assay, mass spectrometry etc. are producing huge data
	sets of protein-protein interactions which can be portrayed as networks,
	and one of the burning issues is to find protein complexes in such
	networks. The enormous size of protein-protein interaction (PPI)
	networks warrants development of efficient computational methods
	for extraction of significant complexes.RESULTS:This paper presents
	an algorithm for detection of protein complexes in large interaction
	networks. In a PPI network, a node represents a protein and an edge
	represents an interaction. The input to the algorithm is the associated
	matrix of an interaction network and the outputs are protein complexes.
	The complexes are determined by way of finding clusters, i. e. the
	densely connected regions in the network. We also show and analyze
	some protein complexes generated by the proposed algorithm from typical
	PPI networks of Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A
	comparison between a PPI and a random network is also performed in
	the context of the proposed algorithm.CONCLUSION:The proposed algorithm
	makes it possible to detect clusters of proteins in PPI networks
	which mostly represent molecular biological functional units. Therefore,
	protein complexes determined solely based on interaction data can
	help us to predict the functions of proteins, and they are also useful
	to understand and explain certain biological processes.},

@article{Bader03,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND:Recent advances in proteomics technologies such as two-hybrid,
	phage display and mass spectrometry have enabled us to create a detailed
	map of biomolecular interaction networks. Initial mapping efforts
	have already produced a wealth of data. As the size of the interaction
	set increases, databases and computational methods will be required
	to store, visualize and analyze the information in order to effectively
	aid in knowledge discovery.RESULTS:This paper describes a novel graph
	theoretic clustering algorithm, "Molecular Complex Detection" (MCODE),
	that detects densely connected regions in large protein-protein interaction
	networks that may represent molecular complexes. The method is based
	on vertex weighting by local neighborhood density and outward traversal
	from a locally dense seed protein to isolate the dense regions according
	to given parameters. The algorithm has the advantage over other graph
	clustering methods of having a directed mode that allows fine-tuning
	of clusters of interest without considering the rest of the network
	and allows examination of cluster interconnectivity, which is relevant
	for protein networks. Protein interaction and complex information
	from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was used for evaluation.CONCLUSION:Dense
	regions of protein interaction networks can be found, based solely
	on connectivity data, many of which correspond to known protein complexes.
	The algorithm is not affected by a known high rate of false positives
	in data from high-throughput interaction techniques. The program
	is available from ftp://ftp.mshri.on.ca/pub/BIND/Tools/MCODE.},

@article{Ben-Hur05,
	Abstract = {Motivation: Despite advances in high-throughput methods for discovering
	protein-protein interactions, the interaction networks of even well-studied
	model organisms are sketchy at best, highlighting the continued need
	for computational methods to help direct experimentalists in the
	search for novel interactions. Results: We present a kernel method
	for predicting protein-protein interactions using a combination of
	data sources, including protein sequences, Gene Ontology annotations,
	local properties of the network, and homologous interactions in other
	species. Whereas protein kernels proposed in the literature provide
	a similarity between single proteins, prediction of interactions
	requires a kernel between pairs of proteins. We propose a pairwise
	kernel that converts a kernel between single proteins into a kernel
	between pairs of proteins, and we illustrate the kernel's effectiveness
	in conjunction with a support vector machine classifier. Furthermore,
	we obtain improved performance by combining several sequence-based
	kernels based on k-mer frequency, motif and domain content and by
	further augmenting the pairwise sequence kernel with features that
	are based on other sources of data. We apply our method to predict
	physical interactions in yeast using data from the BIND database.
	At a false positive rate of 1% the classifier retrieves close to
	80% of a set of trusted interactions. We thus demonstrate the ability
	of our method to make accurate predictions despite the sizeable fraction
	of false positives that are known to exist in interaction databases.
	Availability: The classification experiments were performed using
	PyML available at http://pyml.sourceforge.net. Data are available

	Abstract = {Motivation: Identification of functional modules in protein interaction
	networks is a first step in understanding the organization and dynamics
	of cell functions. To ensure that the identified modules are biologically
	meaningful, network-partitioning algorithms should take into account
	not only topological features but also functional relationships,
	and identified modules should be rigorously validated. Results: In
	this study we first integrate proteomics and microarray datasets
	and represent the yeast protein-protein interaction network as a
	weighted graph. We then extend a betweenness-based partition algorithm,
	and use it to identify 266 functional modules in the yeast proteome
	network. For validation we show that the functional modules are indeed
	densely connected subgraphs. In addition, genes in the same functional
	module confer a similar phenotype. Furthermore, known protein complexes
	are largely contained in the functional modules in their entirety.
	We also analyze an example of a functional module and show that functional
	modules can be useful for gene annotation. Contact: yuan.33@osu.edu

	Abstract = {Shape complementarity is the most basic ingredient of the scoring
	functions for protein-protein docking. Most grid-based docking algorithms
	use the total number of grid points at the binding interface to quantify
	shape complementarity. We have developed a novel Pairwise Shape Complementarity
	(PSC) function that is conceptually simple and rapid to compute.
	The favorable component of PSC is the total number of atom pairs
	between the receptor and the ligand within a distance cutoff. When
	applied to a benchmark of 49 test cases, PSC consistently ranks near-native
	structures higher and produces more near-native structures than the
	traditional grid-based function, and the improvement was seen across
	all prediction levels and in all categories of the benchmark. Without
	any post-processing or biological information about the binding site
	except the complementarity-determining region of antibodies, PSC
	predicts the complex structure correctly for 6 test cases, and ranks
	at least one near-native structure in the top 20 predictions for
	18 test cases. Our docking program ZDOCK has been parallelized and
	the average computing time is 4 minutes using sixteen IBM SP3 processors.
	Both ZDOCK and the benchmark are freely available to academic users
	(http://zlab.bu.edu/~ rong/dock).},

	Abstract = {We present a new variant of the suffix tree called a distributed suffix
	tree (DST) which allows for much larger databases of strings to be
	handled efficiently. The method is based on a new linear time construction
	algorithm for subtrees of a suffix tree. The new data structure tackles
	the memory bottleneck problem by constructing these subtrees independently

	environments (e.g., Beowulf clusters). The central advantage is that
	standard operations of biological importance on suffix trees are
	shown to be easily translatable to this new data structure. While
	none of these operations on the DST require inter-process communication,
	many have optimal expected parallel running times.},

	Abstract = {An effort to combine theoretical analyses and protein engineering
	methods has been made to probe the folding mechanism of SH3 by using
	Energy Landscape Theory and a -value analysis. Particular emphasis
	was given to core residues and the effect of desolvation during the
	folding event by replacing the core valines with isosteric threonines.
	These mutations have the advantage of keeping the core structurally
	invariant while affecting core stability relative to the unfolded
	state. Although the valines that form the core appear spatially invariant,
	the folding kinetics of their threonine mutants varies, indicating
	their different extent of solvation in the transition-state ensemble.
	Theoretical studies predicted the distribution of folding kinetics
	of threonine mutants without previous knowledge of the measured rates.
	This initial success encourages further investigations of the molecular
	details behind these macroscopic phenomena and of the role of solvation
	in the folding mechanism.},

@article{Fratkin06,
	Abstract = {Motivation: DNA motif finding is one of the core problems in computational
	biology, for which several probabilistic and discrete approaches
	have been developed. Most existing methods formulate motif finding
	as an intractable optimization problem and rely either on expectation
	maximization (EM) or on local heuristic searches. Another challenge
	is the choice of motif model: simpler models such as the position-specific
	scoring matrix (PSSM) impose biologically unrealistic assumptions
	such as independence of the motif positions, while more involved
	models are harder to parametrize and learn. Results: We present MotifCut,
	a graph-theoretic approach to motif finding leading to a convex optimization
	problem with a polynomial time solution. We build a graph where the
	vertices represent all k-mers in the input sequences, and edges represent
	pairwise k-mer similarity. In this graph, we search for a motif as
	the maximum density subgraph, which is a set of k-mers that exhibit
	a large number of pairwise similarities. Our formulation does not
	make strong assumptions regarding the structure of the motif and
	in practice both motifs that fit well the PSSM model, and those that
	exhibit strong dependencies between position pairs are found as dense
	subgraphs. We benchmark MotifCut on both synthetic and real yeast
	motifs, and find that it compares favorably to existing popular methods.
	The ability of MotifCut to detect motifs appears to scale well with
	increasing input size. Moreover, the motifs we discover are different
	from those discovered by the other methods. Availability: MotifCut
	server and other materials can be found at motifcut.stanford.edu

	Abstract = {Summary: The Human Protein Interaction Database (http://www.hpid.org)
	was designed (1) to provide human protein interaction information
	pre-computed from existing structural and experimental data, (2)
	to predict potential interactions between proteins submitted by users
	and (3) to provide a depository for new human protein interaction
	data from users. Two types of interaction are available from the
	pre-computed data: (1) interactions at the protein superfamily level
	and (2) those transferred from the interactions of yeast proteins.
	Interactions at the superfamily level were obtained by locating known
	structural interactions of the PDB in the SCOP domains and identifying
	homologs of the domains in the human proteins. Interactions transferred
	from yeast proteins were obtained by identifying homologs of the
	yeast proteins in the human proteins. For each human protein in the
	database and each query submitted by users, the protein superfamilies
	and yeast proteins assigned to the protein are shown, along with
	their interacting partners. We have also developed a set of web-based
	programs so that users can visualize and analyze protein interaction
	networks in order to explore the networks further. Availability:

@article{Hu05,
	Abstract = {Motivation: The rapid accumulation of biological network data translates
	into an urgent need for computational methods for graph pattern mining.
	One important problem is to identify recurrent patterns across multiple
	networks to discover biological modules. However, existing algorithms
	for frequent pattern mining become very costly in time and space
	as the pattern sizes and network numbers increase. Currently, no
	efficient algorithm is available for mining recurrent patterns across
	large collections of genome-wide networks. Results: We developed
	a novel algorithm, CODENSE, to efficiently mine frequent coherent
	dense subgraphs across large numbers of massive graphs. Compared
	with previous methods, our approach is scalable in the number and
	size of the input graphs and adjustable in terms of exact or approximate
	pattern mining. Applying CODENSE to 39 co-expression networks derived
	from microarray datasets, we discovered a large number of functionally
	homogeneous clusters and made functional predictions for 169 uncharacterized
	yeast genes. Availability: http://zhoulab.usc.edu/CODENSE/ Contact:

@article{jiang95,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Glycoprotein hormones influence the development and function
	of the ovary, testis and thyroid by binding to specific high-affinity
	receptors. The extracellular domains of these receptors are members
	of the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) protein superfamily and are responsible
	for the high-affinity binding. The crystal structure of a glycoprotein
	hormone, namely human choriogonadotropin (hCG), is known, but neither
	the receptor structure, mode of hormone binding, nor mechanism for
	activation, have been established. RESULTS: Despite very low sequence
	similarity between exon-demarcated LRRs in the receptors and the
	LRRs of porcine ribonuclease inhibitor (RI), the secondary structures
	for the two repeat sets are found to be alike Constraints on curvature
	and beta-barrel geometry from the sequence pattern for repeated beta
	alpha units suggest that the receptors contain three-dimensional
	structures similar to that of RI. With the RI crystal structure as
	a template, models were constructed for exons 2-8 of the receptors.
	The model for this portion of the choriogonadotropin receptor is
	complementary in shape and electrostatic characteristics to the surface
	of hCG at an identified focus of hormone-receptor interaction. CONCLUSIONS:
	The predicted models for the structures and mode of hormone binding
	of the glycoprotein hormone receptors are to a large extent consistent
	with currently available biochemical and mutational data. Repeated
	sequences in beta-barrel proteins are shown to have general implications
	for constraints on structure. Averaging techniques used here to recognize
	the structural motif in these receptors should also apply to other
	proteins with repeated sequences.},

	Abstract = {Summary: Biological and engineered networks have recently been shown
	to display network motifs: a small set of characteristic patterns
	that occur much more frequently than in randomized networks with
	the same degree sequence. Network motifs were demonstrated to play
	key information processing roles in biological regulation networks.
	Existing algorithms for detecting network motifs act by exhaustively
	enumerating all subgraphs with a given number of nodes in the network.
	The runtime of such algorithms increases strongly with network size.
	Here, we present a novel algorithm that allows estimation of subgraph
	concentrations and detection of network motifs at a runtime that
	is asymptotically independent of the network size. This algorithm
	is based on random sampling of subgraphs. Network motifs are detected
	with a surprisingly small number of samples in a wide variety of
	networks. Our method can be applied to estimate the concentrations
	of larger subgraphs in larger networks than was previously possible
	with exhaustive enumeration algorithms. We present results for high-order
	motifs in several biological networks and discuss their possible
	functions. Availability: A software tool for estimating subgraph
	concentrations and detecting network motifs (mfinder 1.1) and further
	information is available at http://www.weizmann.ac.il/mcb/UriAlon/

@article{Katchalski-Katzir92,
	Abstract = {A geometric recognition algorithm was developed to identify molecular
	surface complementarity. It is based on a purely geometric approach
	and takes advantage of techniques applied in the field of pattern
	recognition. The algorithm involves an automated procedure including
	(i) a digital representation of the molecules (derived from atomic
	coordinates) by three-dimensional discrete functions that distinguishes
	between the surface and the interior; (ii) the calculation, using
	Fourier transformation, of a correlation function that assesses the
	degree of molecular surface overlap and penetration upon relative
	shifts of the molecules in three dimensions; and (iii) a scan of
	the relative orientations of the molecules in three dimensions. The
	algorithm provides a list of correlation values indicating the extent
	of geometric match between the surfaces of the molecules; each of
	these values is associated with six numbers describing the relative
	position (translation and rotation) of the molecules. The procedure
	is thus equivalent to a six-dimensional search but much faster by
	design, and the computation time is only moderately dependent on
	molecular size. The procedure was tested and validated by using five
	known complexes for which the correct relative position of the molecules
	in the respective adducts was successfully predicted. The molecular
	pairs were deoxyhemoglobin and methemoglobin, tRNA synthetase-tyrosinyl
	adenylate, aspartic proteinase-peptide inhibitor, and trypsin-trypsin
	inhibitor. A more realistic test was performed with the last two
	pairs by using the structures of uncomplexed aspartic proteinase
	and trypsin inhibitor, respectively. The results are indicative of
	the extent of conformational changes in the molecules tolerated by
	the algorithm. [Journal Article; In English; United States]},

@article{Kirac06,
	Abstract = {Motivation: In general, most accurate gene/protein annotations are
	provided by curators. Despite having lesser evidence strengths, it
	is inevitable to use computational methods for fast and a priori
	discovery of protein function annotations. This paper considers the
	problem of assigning Gene Ontology (GO) annotations to partially
	annotated or newly discovered proteins. Results: We present a data
	mining technique that computes the probabilistic relationships between
	GO annotations of proteins on protein-protein interaction data, and
	assigns highly correlated GO terms of annotated proteins to non-annotated
	proteins in the target set. In comparison with other techniques,
	probabilistic suffix tree and correlation mining techniques produce
	the highest prediction accuracy of 81% precision with the recall
	at 45%. Availability: Code is available upon request. Results and
	used materials are available online at http://kirac.case.edu/PROTAN

	Abstract = {Motivation: With rapidly increasing amount of network and interaction
	data in molecular biology, the problem of effectively analyzing this
	data is an important one. Graph theoretic formalisms, commonly used
	for these analysis tasks, often lead to computationally hard problems
	due to their relation with subgraph isomorphism. Results: This paper
	presents an innovative new algorithm for detecting frequently occurring
	patterns and modules in biological networks. Using an innovative
	graph simplification technique, which is ideally suited to biological
	networks, our algorithm renders these problems computationally tractable.
	Indeed, we show experimentally that our algorithm can extract frequently
	occurring patterns in metabolic pathways extracted from the KEGG
	database within seconds. The proposed model and algorithm are applicable
	to a variety of biological networks either directly or with minor
	modifications. Availability: Implementation of the proposed algorithms
	in the C programming language is available as open source at http://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/koyuturk/pathway/

@article{McDermott05,
	Abstract = {Motivation: Progress in large-scale experimental determination of
	protein-protein interaction networks for several organisms has resulted
	in innovative methods of functional inference based on network connectivity.
	However, the amount of effort and resources required for the elucidation
	of experimental protein interaction networks is prohibitive. Previously
	we, and others, have developed techniques to predict protein interactions
	for novel genomes using computational methods and data generated
	from other genomes. Results: We evaluated the performance of a network-based
	functional annotation method that makes use of our predicted protein
	interaction networks. We show that this approach performs equally
	well on experimentally derived and predicted interaction networks,
	for both manually and computationally assigned annotations. We applied
	the method to predicted protein interaction networks for over 50
	organisms from all domains of life, providing annotations for many
	previously unannotated proteins and verifying existing low-confidence
	annotations. Availability: Functional predictions for over 50 organisms
	are available at http://bioverse.compbio.washington.edu and datasets
	used for analysis at http://data.compbio.washington.edu/misc/downloads/nannotation_data/
	Contact: admin@bioverse.compbio.washington.edu Supplementary information:
	A supplemental appendix gives additional details not in the main
	text. (http://data.compbio.washington.edu/misc/downloads/nannotation_data/supplement.pdf).

	Abstract = {Human Protein Reference Database (HPRD) (http://www.hprd.org) was
	developed to serve as a comprehensive collection of protein features,
	post-translational modifications (PTMs) and protein-protein interactions.
	Since the original report, this database has increased to >20 000
	proteins entries and has become the largest database for literature-derived
	protein-protein interactions (>30 000) and PTMs (>8000) for human
	proteins. We have also introduced several new features in HPRD including:
	(i) protein isoforms, (ii) enhanced search options, (iii) linking
	of pathway annotations and (iv) integration of a novel browser, GenProt
	Viewer (http://www.genprot.org), developed by us that allows integration
	of genomic and proteomic information. With the continued support
	and active participation by the biomedical community, we expect HPRD
	to become a unique source of curated information for the human proteome
	and spur biomedical discoveries based on integration of genomic,
	transcriptomic and proteomic data. },

@article{Nabieva05,
	Abstract = {Motivation: Determining protein function is one of the most important
	problems in the post-genomic era. For the typical proteome, there
	are no functional annotations for one-third or more of its proteins.
	Recent high-throughput experiments have determined proteome-scale
	protein physical interaction maps for several organisms. These physical
	interactions are complemented by an abundance of data about other
	types of functional relationships between proteins, including genetic
	interactions, knowledge about co-expression and shared evolutionary
	history. Taken together, these pairwise linkages can be used to build
	whole-proteome protein interaction maps. Results: We develop a network-flow
	based algorithm, FunctionalFlow, that exploits the underlying structure
	of protein interaction maps in order to predict protein function.
	In cross-validation testing on the yeast proteome, we show that FunctionalFlow
	has improved performance over previous methods in predicting the
	function of proteins with few (or no) annotated protein neighbors.
	By comparing several methods that use protein interaction maps to
	predict protein function, we demonstrate that FunctionalFlow performs
	well because it takes advantage of both network topology and some
	measure of locality. Finally, we show that performance can be improved
	substantially as we consider multiple data sources and use them to
	create weighted interaction networks. Availability: http://compbio.cs.princeton.edu/function

@article{Przulj06,
	Abstract = {Motivation: Algorithmic and modeling advances in the area of protein-protein
	interaction (PPI) network analysis could contribute to the understanding
	of biological processes. Local structure of networks can be measured
	by the frequency distribution of graphlets, small connected non-isomorphic
	induced subgraphs. This measure of local structure has been used
	to show that high-confidence PPI networks have local structure of
	geometric random graphs. Finding graphlets exhaustively in a large
	network is computationally intensive. More complete PPI networks,
	as well as PPI networks of higher organisms, will thus require efficient
	heuristic approaches. Results: We propose two efficient and scalable
	heuristics for finding graphlets in high-confidence PPI networks.
	We show that both PPI and their model geometric random networks,
	have defined boundaries that are sparser than the inner parts' of
	the networks. In addition, these networks exhibit uniformity' of
	local structure inside the networks. Our first heuristic exploits
	these two structural properties of PPI and geometric random networks
	to find good estimates of graphlet frequency distributions in these
	networks up to 690 times faster than the exhaustive searches. Our
	second heuristic is a variant of a more standard sampling technique
	and it produces accurate approximate results up to 377 times faster
	than the exhaustive searches. We indicate how the combination of
	these approaches may result in an even better heuristic. Availability:

	Abstract = {Motivation: Many protein-protein interactions are mediated by peptide
	recognition modules (PRMs), compact domains that bind to short peptides,
	and play a critical role in a wide array of biological processes.
	Recent experimental protein interaction data provide us with an opportunity
	to examine whether we may explain, or even predict their interactions
	by computational sequence analysis. Such a question was recently
	posed by the use of random peptide screens to characterize the ligands
	of one such PRM, the SH3 domain. Results: We describe a general computational
	procedure for identifying the ligand peptides of PRMs by combining
	protein sequence information and observed physical interactions into
	a simple probabilistic model and from it derive an interaction-mediated
	de novo motif-finding framework. Using a recent all-versus-all yeast
	two-hybrid SH3 domain interaction network, we demonstrate that our
	technique can be used to derive independent predictions of interactions
	mediated by SH3 domains. We show that only when sequence information
	is combined with such all versus all protein interaction datasets,
	are we capable of identifying motifs with sufficient sensitivity
	and specificity for predicting interactions. The algorithm is general
	so that it may be applied to other PRM domains (e.g. SH2, WW, PDZ).

@article{Rosen1998,
	Abstract = {Here we examine the reliability of surface comparisons in searches
	for active sites in proteins. Detection of a patch of surface on
	one protein which is similar to an active site in another, may suggest
	similarities in enzymatic mechanisms, in enzyme functions and implicate
	a potential target for ligand/inhibitor design. Specifically, we
	compare the efficacy of molecular surface comparisons with comparisons
	of surface atoms and of C(alpha) backbone atoms. We further investigate
	comparisons of specific atoms, belonging to a predefined pattern
	of catalytic residues versus comparisons of molecular surfaces and,
	separately, of surface atoms. This aspect is particularly relevant,
	as catalytic residues may be (partially) buried. We also explore
	active site comparisons versus comparisons in which the entire molecular
	surfaces are scanned. While here we focus on the geometrical aspect
	of the problem, we also investigate the effect of adding residue
	labels in these comparisons. Our extensive studies cover the serine
	proteases, containing the highly conserved triad motif, and the chorismate
	mutases. Since such active site comparisons entail comparisons between
	unconnected points in 3D space, an order-independent comparison technique
	is necessary. The geometric hashing algorithm is ideally suited to
	handling such a task. It can perform both global shape matching for
	the whole surfaces of large protein molecules and searching for local
	shape similarities for small surface motifs. Our results show that
	molecular surface comparisons work best when the similarity is high.
	As the similarity deteriorates, the number of potential solutions
	increases rapidly, making their ranking difficult, particularly when
	scanning entire molecular surfaces. Utilizing atomic coordinates
	directly appears more adequate under such circumstances.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND:The abundant data available for protein interaction networks
	have not yet been fully understood. New types of analyses are needed
	to reveal organizational principles of these networks to investigate
	the details of functional and regulatory clusters of proteins.RESULTS:In
	the present work, individual clusters identified by an eigenmode
	analysis of the connectivity matrix of the protein-protein interaction
	network in yeast are investigated for possible functional relationships
	among the members of the cluster. With our functional clustering
	we have successfully predicted several new protein-protein interactions
	that indeed have been reported recently.CONCLUSION:Eigenmode analysis
	of the entire connectivity matrix yields both a global and a detailed
	view of the network. We have shown that the eigenmode clustering
	not only is guided by the number of proteins with which each protein
	interacts, but also leads to functional clustering that can be applied
	to predict new protein interactions.},

@article{Spirin03,
	Abstract = {Proteins, nucleic acids, and small molecules form a dense network
	of molecular interactions in a cell. Molecules are nodes of this
	network, and the interactions between them are edges. The architecture
	of molecular networks can reveal important principles of cellular
	organization and function, similarly to the way that protein structure
	tells us about the function and organization of a protein. Computational
	analysis of molecular networks has been primarily concerned with
	node degree [Wagner, A. & Fell, D. A. (2001) Proc. R. Soc. London
	Ser. B 268, 1803-1810; Jeong, H., Tombor, B., Albert, R., Oltvai,
	Z. N. & Barabasi, A. L. (2000) Nature 407, 651-654] or degree correlation
	[Maslov, S. & Sneppen, K. (2002) Science 296, 910-913], and hence
	focused on single/two-body properties of these networks. Here, by
	analyzing the multibody structure of the network of protein-protein
	interactions, we discovered molecular modules that are densely connected
	within themselves but sparsely connected with the rest of the network.
	Comparison with experimental data and functional annotation of genes
	showed two types of modules: (i) protein complexes (splicing machinery,
	transcription factors, etc.) and (ii) dynamic functional units (signaling
	cascades, cell-cycle regulation, etc.). Discovered modules are highly
	statistically significant, as is evident from comparison with random
	graphs, and are robust to noise in the data. Our results provide
	strong support for the network modularity principle introduced by
	Hartwell et al. [Hartwell, L. H., Hopfield, J. J., Leibler, S. &
	Murray, A. W. (1999) Nature 402, C47-C52], suggesting that found
	modules constitute the "building blocks" of molecular networks. },

	critical for interrogation of gene/protein function and analysis
	of global network properties. BioGRID is a freely accessible database
	of physical and genetic interactions available at http://www.thebiogrid.org.
	BioGRID release version 2.0 includes >116 000 interactions from Saccharomyces
	cerevisiae, Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster and Homo
	sapiens. Over 30 000 interactions have recently been added from 5778
	sources through exhaustive curation of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae
	primary literature. An internally hyper-linked web interface allows
	for rapid search and retrieval of interaction data. Full or user-defined
	datasets are freely downloadable as tab-delimited text files and
	PSI-MI XML. Pre-computed graphical layouts of interactions are available
	in a variety of file formats. User-customized graphs with embedded
	protein, gene and interaction attributes can be constructed with
	a visualization system called Osprey that is dynamically linked to
	the BioGRID. },

@article{Yu06,
	Abstract = {Datasets obtained by large-scale, high-throughput methods for detecting
	protein-protein interactions typically suffer from a relatively high
	level of noise. We describe a novel method for improving the quality
	of these datasets by predicting missed protein-protein interactions,
	using only the topology of the protein interaction network observed
	by the large-scale experiment. The central idea of the method is
	to search the protein interaction network for defective cliques (nearly
	complete complexes of pairwise interacting proteins), and predict
	the interactions that complete them. We formulate an algorithm for
	applying this method to large-scale networks, and show that in practice
	it is efficient and has good predictive performance. More information
	can be found on our website http://topnet.gersteinlab.org/clique/
