Build :

make -f Mine.mk -j 4

Clean :

make -f Mine.mk clean

Run :

1) Preprocess the input graph to compute the k-hop labels for vertices in the pattern. To compute the k-hop labels, use
the script get_hops from the scripts sub-directory.
2) Edit or supply a new config file with appropriate path names and parameters for the program.
3) Execute :

./mine <config file> <log file> <stat file>

Misc :

1) OFFSET parameter is used when the input is a database of graphs instead
of a single graph. All the representaties between the same set of
consecutive offsets are considered similar.
